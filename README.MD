# My Movies

An Android app sample with Jetpack Compose in MVVM architecture. This app fetches movie data from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (a.k.a. [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)) API and displays movies information.

## Features

Browse movies (trending, top-rateed, popular...), posters, backdrops, people's profile, images, and search for movies.

The language of the movie data from the TMDB server depends on your device's settings; therefore, the movie's content will be updated accordingly.

## Build

Before build the project, you have to register [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for an [API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api), and replace with your access token in **app/build.gradle.kts** file.

> *In build.gradle.kts file, Replace **YOUR_TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN** with yor access token.*
