# My Movies

An Android app sample with Jetpack Compose in MVVM architecture. This app fetches movie data from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (a.k.a. [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)) API and displays movies information.

## Features

Browse movies (trending, top-rated, popular...), posters, backdrops, people's profile, images, and search for movies.

The language of the movie data from the TMDB server depends on your device's settings; therefore, the movie's content will be updated accordingly.

## Download

Latest released apk: [my-movies-v1.2.0.apk](https://github.com/neilchennc/my-movies/releases/download/v1.2.0/my-movies-v1.2.0.apk)

## Build

Before building the project, you have to register on [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for an [API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api), and you will find an API access token in your account settings page.

After that, add the following line into **local.properties** file, and replace with your TMDB access token:

```properties
tmdb.access_token="YOUR_TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

> *Note: The local.properties file is created by Android Studio IDE when you open the project.*

> *Recommended upgrading to the latest stable Android Studio and enabling K2 mode.*
